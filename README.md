# Blizzard Jailbreak
An Open-Source, fully working iOS 9.0 to 9.3.6, 32-Bit Jailbreak. 

This jailbreak is aimed at the beginner Jailbreak Developers who want to learn how to build iOS Jailbreaks.
The code is kept simple with only the necessary components being added, while keeping a functional jailbreak.

Feel free to mess with the code as long as you do proper crediting where it is due.
